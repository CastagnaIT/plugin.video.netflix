## Notice for the use of auto-update and auto-sync with Netflix "My List" feature

AN INTENSIVE USE OF THIS FEATURES due to many exported tv shows MAY CAUSE A TEMPORARY BAN OF THE ACCOUNT that varies starting from 24/48 hours. Use at your own risk.

If it happens often, there is the possibility to exclude the auto update from the tv shows, by open context menu on a tv show and selecting `Exclude from auto update`.

## Something doesn't work

***Before open an issue please try read the Wiki pages or ask for help in the Kodi forum***

If something doesn't work for you:
1. Open add-on settings, go to in Expert page and change `Debug logging level` to `Verbose`
2. Enable the Debug log in your Kodi settings
3. Perform the actions that cause the error, so they are written in the log
4. Open a new github issue (of type *Problem report*) by following the instructions in the report

We can't help you if you don't provide detailed information (i.e. explanation and full debug log) on your issue.
Please also use a service like pastebin or better [Kodi paste](http://paste.kodi.tv) to provide logs and refrain from uploading them to where they'll be hidden behind an ad-wall or any other sketchy services.

When the problem will be solved, remember to disable the debug logging, to avoid unnecessary slowing down in your device.
